<!--
Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found in push2cloud. Please fill in
the template below by replacing the html comments with an appropriate answer.
If unsure about something, just do as best as you're able.

Version: version property in package.json
Platform: either `uname -a` output, or if Windows, version and 32 or 64-bit.
Module: i.e. push2cloud-compiler
Node: i.e. node -v
Npm: i.e. npm -v

It will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that reproduces
the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any external
dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce your code
to a small test case, but we would appreciate to have as
much data as possible.

Thank you!
